                        <p>We're thrilled you're participating in Big Butterfly Month and documenting these delicate creatures with us. However, it seems we're missing some crucial information on your end.</p>
                        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è We couldn't find your user details! ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>
                        <p>Don't worry, your previously submitted forms are safe. If you've already documented butterflies this month and they're not visible, here's what you can do:</p>
                        <p><b>1. Submit Another Form:</b> Simply submit another checklist of butterflies. This will help us locate and display your previous submissions.</p>
                        <p><b>2. Double-Check Email:</b> Make sure your email address is correctly stored. This ensures we can connect your submissions to you accurately.</p>
                        <p><b>3. Smooth Sailing Ahead:</b> Once you've submitted another checklist, your previous forms should reappear like magic. We're working diligently to ensure your valuable contributions are counted.</p>
                        <p>Remember, every butterfly you document makes a difference in our understanding of these beautiful creatures and their habitats. Your dedication is greatly appreciated!</p>
                        <p>If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at support@bigbutterflymonth.org. We're here to help you make your butterfly observations count.</p>
